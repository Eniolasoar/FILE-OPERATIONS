1.2 An Overview of the Definitions of Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneur
1.1.1 Entrepreneurship
There are many definitions of the concept ‘entrepreneurship’. For instance, Putari (2006) observes
that scholars had not been in agreement in their definitions of entrepreneurship and chronicled the
definitions of entrepreneurship by various scholars (Brockhaus & Horwitz, 1986, Sexton & Smilor, Wortman,
1987; Gartner, 1988). Cantillon (circa 1730) views entrepreneurship as: “self employment of any sort”.
In 1934, Joseph Schumpeter equated entrepreneurship with the concept of innovation and applied it to a business context,
 while emphasizing the combination of resources. Penrose (1963) views entrepreneurship as the activity that involves
identifying opportunities within the economic system. While Leibenstein (1968, 1979) perceives entrepreneurship as involving "activities necessary to create or carry on an enterprise where not all markets are well established or clearly defined and/or
in which relevant parts of the production function are not completely known”. Gartner (1988) conceives entrepreneurship as
the creation of new organizations. Okpara (2000) defines entrepreneurship as the willingness and ability of an individual to
seek out investment opportunities in an environment and be able to establish and run an enterprise successfully based on the
identifiable opportunities. In addition, Nwachukwu (1990) regards entrepreneurship as a process of seeing and evaluating
business opportunities, gathering the necessary resources to take advantage of them and initiate appropriate action to ensure success.
After critically studying the above definitions, we can summarize by concluding that entrepreneurship is a function which involves
the exploitation of opportunities which exist within a market.
